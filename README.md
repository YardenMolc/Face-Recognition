# Face-Recognition
Face Recognition - multiple faces using HOG with GUI

My girlfriend had her birthday 2 weeks ago and I want to surprise her with a photo collage, 
the problem was that I have on my phone 12K of photos,
I know android and IOS have face recognition feature but I wanted to detect if there are 2 and more people in the photo (for example my GF, her mom and myself)
so I decided to build a mini-program in python using Tkinter and threading (needed a multi-process to run over 12K photos)


First install face_recognition

pip install pip install face-recognition

step by step instructions:
1) create main folder , under the main folder create a new folder for the person you want to detect , upload to this folder 10+ photos and repeat for each person
2) run the Face.py program
3) click the browse button and choose the main folder from step 1
4) choose number of bots ,click confirm and start the program.
5) when complete choose face detection and choose the path to the test folder and click start
6) in the new window choose which photos do you want and save them by clicking the button.

Enjoy
